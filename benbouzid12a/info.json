    "abstract": "The MULTIBOOST package provides a fast C++ implementation of multi-class/multi-label/multi-task boosting algorithms. It is based on ADABOOST.MH but it also implements popular cascade classifiers and FILTERBOOST. The package contains common multi-class base learners (stumps, trees, products, Haar filters). Further base learners and strong learners following the boosting paradigm can be easily implemented in a flexible framework.",
