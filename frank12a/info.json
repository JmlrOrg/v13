    "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic model for clustering Boolean data where an object can be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters. By explicitly modeling the underlying generative process that combines the  individual source emissions, highly structured data are expressed with substantially fewer clusters compared to single-assignment clustering. As a consequence, such a model provides robust parameter estimators even when the number of samples is low. We extend the model with different noise processes and demonstrate that maximum-likelihood estimation with multiple assignments consistently infers source parameters more accurately than single-assignment clustering. Our model is primarily motivated by the task of role mining for role-based access control, where users of a system are assigned one or more roles. In experiments with real-world access-control data, our model exhibits better generalization performance than state-of-the-art approaches.",
